<summary>Day 1: Introduction to React</summary>



🗓 **Date:** February 11, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

Today I finally started my first React course with Scrimba! I've been listening to their podcast a lot and have been eager to try out their classes. So far, I am impressed! I love the fact that the teacher constantly enforces scrimba students to practice what they learned in almost every lesson.

The introduction is going well so far - everything seems to be understandable and not scary :)

I have a better understanding why developers use React! It is composable (you can easily breakdown a big project into mini more manageable components for easier use and navigation. It also makes coding more effective - what takes a developer several lines of code to develop a simple feature in Vanilla JavaScript, might take only one line of code in React!

🧠 **What I learned:**
- That React is composable & declarative
- Different ways to set up React in the project
- What are JSX, React Components and how to use them
- Outside of Scrimba, I learned how to set up React locally on my computer, using VS code

👩🏼‍💻 **What I built:**
- I already started to build my [first React project](https://github.com/codedbypolina/learning-react)! It is a simple landing page that enforces me to practice how to set up React, use JSX and organize components. With this project I realized that I started to forget some CSS, so I need to refresh my memory on its important basics (e.g. flexbox...)

<summary>Day 2: CSS background image</summary>

🗓 **Date:** February 12, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

Today I finished building my [first React project](https://github.com/codedbypolina/learning-react)! I mostly updated styling - background image in particular. Since I never learned how to use the background image, I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZRFwWQt2w) by Kevin Powell to understand the basics.

🧠 **What I learned:**
- To use an image in the background, I should use background-image in CSS rather than putting the image in HTML
- It's better to use padding instead of height. When you need set a section or adjust image height, it is better to use padding instead. This is especially a better approach for the responsive design
- Avoid using big images to keep the file size as low as possible. For a background image, 1200 pixels is mostly enough.
- Make sure that the text is readable on top of the background image. One of the options is to use background-blend-mode: **multiply** is for darkening the image; **lighten** is for lightening the image. Make sure to have a background-color as well to use this property!

<summary>Day 3: Working on React Solo Project</summary>

🗓 **Date:** February 13, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

Today I started working on a Solo Project - a project where I was only given design without any directions or guides on how to complete it. The task was to code digital business card using React and CSS. This project, once again, enforced me to practice React basics: setting up React locally on my computer, using JSX syntax and organizing React components properly within the files. However, it also helped me to refresh my memories on CSS!

🧠 **What I learned:**
- Center elements with CSS. This [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) was particularly useful!
- How to use border-radius for images and other elements

👩🏼‍💻 **What I built:**
- I started building my [React Solo Project](https://github.com/codedbypolina/digital-business-card)!

<summary>Day 4: Completing React Solo Project</summary>

🗓 **Date:** February 14, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

Today I didn't make a lot of progress - I only had time to finish React Solo Project. However, with that, I am moving to the next part of Scrimba React Course! Super excited for that😁

🧠 **What I learned:**
- Not much, to be honest. Today was a short and straightforward coding day!

👩🏼‍💻 **What I built:**
- I finished my [React Solo Project](https://github.com/codedbypolina/digital-business-card)!

<summary>Day 5: Starting Airbnb Project</summary>

🗓 **Date:** February 15, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

I started the second part of Scrimba React Course! In this section, I will be learning about props and creating components from an array. Today I created a new [React project](https://github.com/codedbypolina/airbnb-experience-react) and mostly worked with CSS and basic React that I learned so far.

🧠 **What I learned:**
- I reminded myself how to use box-shadow😅
- How to use width's max/min/fit-content keywords to make the image more responsive!

👩🏼‍💻 **What I built:**
- I started [Airbnb Clone React Project](https://github.com/codedbypolina/airbnb-experience-react)!

<summary>Day 6: Updating personal website</summary>

🗓 **Date:** February 16, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

Today I postponed coding till the very last hour of the day, and...suprise-suprise! I felt too exhausted to learn anything. Instead, I updated my portfolio website, adding the Coming Soon section.

Reminder for myself: Try to code at the beginning of the day, since at the end of the day you could get too exshausted to learn or code anything!

🧠 **What I learned:**
- Nothing since I just updated my website. Small progress is still a progress!

👩🏼‍💻 **What I built:**
- I updated my [personal portfolio](https://www.codedbypolina.com/)

<summary>Day 7: Building Exercise App</summary>

🗓 **Date:** February 17, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

Today I did a lot of progress! I learned about React props, useState hook, and how to create separate React pages using Router.

I also built a simple exercise app for my Mobile Development class in the university. This app gives the user a list of exercises to pick from, however all these exercises are of two types - ones that require timer (ex: biking) and others that require repetitions input (push ups). Once the user clicks on one of the exercises, he/she is taking to another page where the user can either track time or reps. In both pages, user is allowed to reset the input or return to home page. 

I enjoyed building this app, since I am finally starting to see the power of React! I'm also gradually understanding that React isn't as terrifying as I thought at first!

🧠 **What I learned:**
- React props - why they are important and how to use them!
- useState hook. I haven't dived deeper into hooks in general and why they are useful, however, I learned why useState hook is particulary important and implemented this knowledge for the app!
- How to create separate pages in React, using Router. Suprisingly implementing this knowledge in the exercise app, was the most challenging thing to do overall! I faced with page loading issues while figuring it out, but at the end I made it work🥳

👩🏼‍💻 **What I built:**
- I built an exercise app! I hope to link it later, once I confirm with the professor that it's okay to make my work public!

<summary>Day 8: React props practice</summary>

🗓 **Date:** February 18, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

Today I didn't feel like doing a lot, so I watched several Scrimba videos where I practiced how to use props. Next Scrimba lesson goes through .map method - something I've been struggling in the past to fully comprehend, so I will be needing to take some time to overview this concept as well as learn how to map through components. And, to be honest, I just don't have energy to do so today, so I am postponing it for tomorrow.

From my past 2 attempts to do 100 days of code in a row, I understand that it's important to not burn myself out so I am choosing to not force myself to learn this concept today! 

🧠 **What I learned:**
- Mostly practiced how React props work thanks to Scrimba (truly enjoying this platform!)

👩🏼‍💻 **What I built:**
- I updated my [Airbnb Clone Project](https://github.com/codedbypolina/airbnb-experience-react) by incorporating props into the project

<summary>Day 9: Array.maps() in React</summary>

🗓 **Date:** February 19, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

Today I took time to better understand array.map() method and succesfully implemented this knowledge in Airbnb Clone project! However, I am struggling to map images in the project. I hope to figure it out tomorrow!

🧠 **What I learned:**
- Array.map() method
- How to implement .map() in React

👩🏼‍💻 **What I built:**
- I updated my [Airbnb Clone Project](https://github.com/codedbypolina/airbnb-experience-react) by incorporating .map method
