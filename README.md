<summary>Introduction to React</summary>



🗓 **Date:** February 11, 2023

📝 **Personal Notes:**

Today I finally started my first React course with Scrimba! I've been listening to their podcast a lot and have been eager to try out their classes. So far, I am impressed! I love the fact that the teacher constantly enforces scrimba students to practice what they learned in almost every lesson.

The introduction is going well so far - everything seems to be understandable and not scary :)

I have a better understanding why developers use React! It is composable (you can easily breakdown a big project into mini more manageable components for easier use and navigation. It also makes coding more effective - what takes a developer several lines of code to develop a simple feature in Vanilla JavaScript, might take only one line of code in React!

🧠 **What I learned:**
- That React is composable & declarative
- How to set up React
- What are JSX, React Components and how to use them
- Outside of Scrimba, I learned how to set up React locally on my computer, using VS code

👩🏼‍💻 **What I built:**
- I already started to build my [first React project](https://github.com/codedbypolina/learning-react)! It is a simple landing page that enforces me to practice how to set up React, use JSX and organize components. With this project I realized that I started to forget some CSS, so I need to refresh my memory on its important basics (e.g. flexbox...)
